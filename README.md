# Aternicord

- WARNING: This bot is very use at your own risk as it techinically goes against Aternos TOS
- It utilizes the python-aternos API created by DarkCat09 (I played no part in it's creation):
  https://github.com/DarkCat09/python-aternos/tree/main?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme
- Given the API was depreciated in early 2024 it (and therefore the bot) is potentially unstable and inconsistent (due to no fault of the creator)

- I'm hosting this instance of Aternicord on a personal server, hosting it on a free service such as Replit/UptimeRobot causes it to be screwed over by a slew of capchas as well as CloudFare (again, due to no fault of the creater of the API)
- Given hosting a Python based project like this (especially one relying on non deb packages and outdated builds of python) on a Debian based server is an absolute pain in the ass to maintain alongside other projects, I make no promises this will be/remain active

# Aternicord

- WARNING: This bot is very use at your own risk as it techinically goes against Aternos TOS
- It utilizes the python-aternos API created by DarkCat09 (I played no part in it's creation):
  https://github.com/DarkCat09/python-aternos/tree/main?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme
- Given the API was depreciated in early 2024 it (and therefore the bot) is potentially unstable and inconsistent (due to no fault of the creator)
